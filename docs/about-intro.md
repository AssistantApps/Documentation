# Intro

The AssistantApps brand is a collection of apps that are aimed at helping players of certain games get the best experience possible for those games. 

## How it started

The first apps built were the Android and iOS versions of the [Assistant for No Man's Sky][assistantNMS]. After the success of the No Man's Sky app, [Kurt][kurt] decided to try creating a new app called [Assistant for Scrap Mechanic][assistantSMS] with the goal of creating an app that works on Android, iOS and on the web from one codebase using [Flutter][flutter]. In the process of building the app [Kurt][kurt] realised that many of the page structures and components were the same and that he could reduce the amount of copy and pasting `(copy-pasta)` in the apps by making a centralised library and API for common functions.
