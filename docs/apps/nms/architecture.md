## Initial plan

Originally the app was designed to have everything be offline. Building, hosting and maintaining a server is costly especially in situations where it is not needed. As NMS was not updating frequently, there seemed to be no need. Over the last few years of updates and features added to the game such as lore heavy Weekend Missions, Expeditions etc. The need for a backend server increased and the architecture of the Assistant for No Man's Sky apps became more complex.
