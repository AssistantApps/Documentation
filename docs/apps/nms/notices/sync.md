# Synchronise

### Can I sync with the game?
No. That is not currently possible. \
No Man's Sky save files are stored on your device (PC, Xbox, PS5, etc). They are not synchronised with HelloGames services and so there is no way to fetch your save files from HelloGames. This is also why save editing is easy to do for No Man's Sky compared to online games such as Destiny or Genshin Impact.

### You are wrong, my saves files are backed up to the cloud
Your save files may be backup up to the cloud with a service provided by Steam, PSN, etc, but we do not have access to or permission from those companies to fetch your save files. As far as I am aware, there is no 3rd party app that is able to fetch your save data from these services.

### What is it for?
The Synchronise feature allows you to export and import your Portal and inventory in the Assistant for No Man's Sky apps. This function is no longer an online backup, due to instability. 

### When will Google Drive sync be added back?
Not anytime soon. We may create our own service to store the app data in future but this is not guaranteed.
